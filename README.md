[deployment link] (https://royshalz.github.io/bootP1/)

I have made this art website entirely using HTML and bootstrap which contains a nav bar for home, about us, services and a search button than a slider where I have use some of my own made digital painting following with a quotes. then I have made a progress bar, contact and address within which I have embedded a map following with the footer section for about the website and important links.
